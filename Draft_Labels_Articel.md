# LNbits Introducing Labels  
### A new way to sort, group, and understand your payments easily.

If you are using LNbits, you already know how flexible and lightweight it is. It gives creators, shops, developers, families, and entire communities the tools to manage Lightning payments in a simple way.
Now LNbits has added a feature that looks small at first glance but turns out to be incredibly useful: Labels.  

With labels, you can group payments or wallets under custom names like “Family Transaction”, “Black Week Promotion”, “Event Community”, or whatever fits your needs.
It’s easy, it’s flexible, and the “oh wow, this helps a lot” moment comes very fast.

## What Are Labels?  
A label is a tag you create inside LNbits. You can assign it to invoices:  

  - after the invoice was already created,
  - or directly through the API if you are integrating LNbits into an app.

> We called them Labels, just like GitHub has.

Think of it as little organizers for your payment world. They help you group, filter, track, and review Lightning transactions in a way that give you more power.

## Why Labels will Matter  
When you run a store, host events, or manage multiple projects you might have used separate wallets, a custom solution or spreadsheets to keep things apart.
**Labels change that.**

They let you keep everything in one wallet while still organizing it clearly. Its also possible to create a CSV and Filter them with ease. This makes LNbits not only more powerful but also much easier for everyone to use.

### Example 1  

**A Shop Owner With Multiple Categories**

Imagine you run a small business with:  

  -	a physical shop,
  -	an online shop,
  -	a special sale week.  

Before labels, you either needed multiple wallets or manual tracking.  Now you simply create labels like:  

  -	“Store Offline”
  -	“Store Online”
  -	“Black Week Promo”  

Every time you create an invoice, you choose the matching label. Later, you filter by label and instantly see:  

  -	how much Black Week brought in,
  -	how much came from your online shop,
  -	how your normal offline store performed.  

 > Make business decisions based on clean data without any extra tools.

### Example 2  

**Events, Meetups, Workshops**  

Let’s say you organize a Bitcoin meetup and accept Lightning tips or payments for drinks and snacks.  You create a label like “Meetup October”.
During the event, everyone pays as usual.  

After the event, you filter all transactions by the label.  Boom — you instantly see:  

  -	how many tips came in,
  -	how much revenue the event generated,
  -	the exact list of every payment tied to that meetup.  


> makes accounting becomes effortless.

## Why This Makes LNbits Even Greater  

LNbits has always focused on being simple, modular, and approachable. Labels add the missing piece.  

  -	Clearer overviews
  -	Faster bookkeeping
  -	Better insights
  -	Cleaner integration for developers
  -	Stronger workflow for shops and creators
  -	Easy filterable CSV export.  

All without needing external management tools.
